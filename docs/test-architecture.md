# Test architecture

This document describes the test layers **this repository** owns, with measured numbers for the
current state. The canonical, cross-repository description of all layers — what each one proves, what
it deliberately does not prove, and the reality-declaration requirement — lives in
`DFXswiss/backend` under `docs/test-architecture.md`. Read that one first if you need the whole picture.

Current state and target are kept apart on purpose. Sections marked _target_ describe what is not
built yet; nothing here may describe a capability as existing when it does not.

## The layers this repository owns

| Layer              | Location                        | What it proves                                                               | What it cannot prove                                               | Runs in CI                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unit               | `src/`                          | the logic of a component, hook or utility, with its surroundings replaced    | that any two parts fit together                                    | drafts run (forks may wait as `action_required`); suite full / related / none                    |
| Handbook deep-link | `scripts/handbook/deep-link.js` | `?shot=` / `?group=` / hash isolate one handbook card in a fake document     | the browser after Basic Auth, or that nginx serves the query       | `handbook-check.yaml` (drafts that touch handbook paths; Ready does not start CI)                |
| Full-stack E2E     | `e2e-stack/`                    | the seam between frontend, API and database: screens, contracts, persistence | any money movement — every process-gated job is off during the run | drafts run (job `mode=none` without `ci:full`); stack only with `ci:full` / main / bare dispatch |
| Visual regression  | `e2e/`                          | appearance against committed screenshot baselines                            | function                                                           | no                                                                                               |

The processing chain behind the API — incoming transfers, AML, purchase calculation, liquidity,
payout, ledger booking — is **not** testable from this repository. It belongs to the integration
layer in `DFXswiss/backend`, which runs against a real database. Do not try to cover it from here.

## Current state — measured

### Unit suite — `npm run test`

Measured on `develop` at `4e9544a9`, 2026-08-10, Node 20, with
`npm test -- --coverage`:

| Metric     | Coverage | Absolute     |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Statements | 18.15 %  | 2 578/14 198 |
| Branches   | 17.31 %  | 2 054/11 861 |
| Functions  | 14.44 %  | 668/4 626    |
| Lines      | 18.63 %  | 2 375/12 742 |

950 tests passing across 81 suites, 353 files instrumented.

Read that number together with the coverage rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, section
"Coverage": every file a pull request touches must reach 100 % on
all four metrics, and CI does not enforce it — it is a review gate. With the repository at 18 %, that
means touching a long-neglected file makes its whole coverage your obligation. Plan for it rather
than discovering it in review.

### Handbook deep-link — `node --test scripts/handbook/deep-link.node-test.cjs`

Five cases in `scripts/handbook/deep-link.node-test.cjs`: query over hash, `?group=`, id prefixes,
isolate, and clearing a previous `handbook-target`. This is not the Jest suite. It runs in
`handbook-check.yaml` before the image build. A green run does not prove the live page after
Basic Auth.

### Full-stack E2E — `npm run e2e:stack`

This layer arrived with #1288 and lives in `e2e-stack/`.

Measured on the head of that pull request, `acb6814a`, in CI: 223 tests, of which 219 passed, 3 were
skipped and 1 failed, in 9.6 minutes on a single worker. The failure was the route gate doing its job —
the merge target had gained a route the registry did not claim yet. Re-measure after any change to the
suite; the number of tests is not pinned anywhere.

The harness runs the following for real: Postgres, the API, this frontend, a browser. It fakes every
external provider through two independent mechanisms: the API mocks its own outbound calls, and the
Docker network it sits on has no route to the internet at all. The second is what carries the guarantee,
and `e2e-stack/env/api.env` says so itself: the `loc` mock "only covers calls made through the API's
central HTTP wrapper", while "[w]hat guarantees no external system is ever contacted is the network the
API sits on". Any call that reaches out without going through that wrapper is therefore outside the
mock's scope. Which calls those are, and how many, is a property of the API and not verifiable from this
repository.

The details — the factories and the states that are deliberately not achievable — are in
`e2e-stack/README.md` and `e2e-stack/docs/test-data.md`.

### Route coverage is enforced, not tracked by hand

The gate reads the route definitions out of `src/App.tsx`, resolves nested paths, and fails when a route
has no registry claim or more than one — including two claims inside the same registry file — or when
the spec file a claim names does not exist. App 2.0 is claimed separately as hosted `/app2/` paths
(`e2e-stack/specs/registry/app2.ts`); those are not in `src/App.tsx`. A green unit run does not prove
the full-stack harness cloned `DFXswiss/api` or opened those hashes. When `E2E_FULL_RUN=1` is set, it additionally fails for a
claimed route the browser never opened. That flag is declared by the run, not measured from it, so it may
only be set when the run really covers every spec: `e2e-stack/scripts/run.sh` sets it when it was given
no arguments and clears it otherwise — clearing matters because `e2e-stack/compose.tests.yml` forwards
whatever the caller's environment holds — and the CI workflow sets it when it brings the stack up (full run).
Develop PRs without `ci:full` never set it; `ci:full`, PRs into `main`, and a bare `workflow_dispatch`
(empty `base_ref`) force that full invocation.
Adding a route therefore means adding a claim in `e2e-stack/specs/registry/` and a test that navigates
there.

That gate is the pattern the reality declaration follows: **measure the run, do not trust the
declaration.** Anything its parser cannot resolve is a hard failure rather than a silent omission.

## Reality declaration — hard requirement

Full definition, including the categories that count as a fake and the mandatory fields per entry, is in
`DFXswiss/backend` under `docs/test-architecture.md` — that document owns the taxonomy, and its exact extent
is not verifiable from this repository. The short form that binds every pull request here:

Whenever you introduce, remove or change a fake — a faked external provider, a disabled cron job, a
schema built without the migration chain, state written directly with SQL, a placeholder value that
looks real, a suppressed side effect, or a seed correction that bends reality — the declaration
changes in the same pull request, and each entry says in one plain sentence what a green run does
**not** prove. A pull request that adds a fake without its declaration is incomplete regardless of
whether CI is green.

Write the declaration entry **before** building the fake. Reversed, it becomes documentation written
from memory, with omissions.

## Reality declaration — entries

This section lists the fakes introduced by this repository's own suites and states what a green
run does not prove for each one; the taxonomy and cross-repository entries live in
`DFXswiss/backend` under `docs/test-architecture.md`.

- **The buy-process specs answer the quote endpoint themselves.** `e2e/buy-process.spec.ts` fulfils
  `**/v1/buy/paymentInfos` with static payloads, so a green run proves that the screen renders those
  payloads, not that the API produces them. Unit tests against the utility pin the payload shapes
  instead.
- **The RealUnit quotes and dashboard visual specs answer the admin list themselves.**
  `e2e/realunit-quotes.spec.ts` and `e2e/realunit-dashboard.spec.ts` fulfil
  `GET /v1/realunit/admin/quotes` (and, on the dashboard, holders, token info, price history,
  transactions, the three admin stats paths buy-volume, holders and registration,
  `GET /v1/realunit/referral/admin/prize-wallet`,
  `GET /v1/realunit/referral/admin/payouts`, and
  `GET/PUT /v1/realunit/admin/buy-limit`) with synthetic fixtures that include
  `userId`, `userName` and `deactivatedAt`.
  They also fulfil staff/bootstrap GETs (`/v1/language`, `/v1/fiat`, `/v1/asset`, `/v1/bankAccount`,
  `/v1/country`, `/v1/setting/infoBanner`, `/v2/user`) so a synthetic unsigned JWT does not 401.
  The dashboard spec also fulfils `GET /v1/realunit/referral/admin/prize-wallet/alerts`,
  `GET /v1/realunit/account/:address` and `GET /v1/realunit/account/:address/history`,
  and it answers price history, buy volume, holder count, registration, the prize wallet
  and the buy limit with HTTP errors when a scenario asks for the error state.
  A green run proves the overview, treasury, insights, holder, transaction and account
  fixtures render, including those error states. It does not prove that the API returns
  those payloads, that login or token verification works, or that the staff, stats,
  prize-wallet, alert, payout, buy-limit or account endpoints return real data.
- **The RealUnit support visual spec answers the issue list and thread itself.**
  `e2e/realunit-support.spec.ts` fulfils the RealUnit support list, counts, activity, clerks,
  issue data and messages with synthetic fixtures. Auth is a synthetic unsigned Admin JWT.
  Staff bootstrap GETs and `GET /v2/user` are fulfilled, unmatched `GET /v1/**` returns `[]`,
  and other unmatched `/v1/**` methods return `{}`. A green run proves those list and issue
  fixtures render. It does not prove production auth, that the API returns those issues, or
  that sending a message reaches the server.
- **The RealUnit referral visual spec answers the relation list and promo list itself.**
  `e2e/realunit-referral.spec.ts` fulfils `GET /v1/realunit/referral/admin/relations` and
  `GET /v1/realunit/referral/promo` with synthetic fixtures: an empty promo list on the
  original list screenshot, and one shareable campaign code on the landing-link and QR-dialog
  variants, plus a synthetic unsigned Admin JWT and staff/bootstrap GETs (`/v1/language`,
  `/v1/fiat`, `/v1/asset`, `/v1/bankAccount`, `/v1/country`, `/v1/setting/infoBanner`,
  `/v2/user`). A green run proves the start-promo form, empty promo list, filled promo row
  with `realunit.app/promo/{code}` and QR overlay, held-for-review relation table and detail
  fixtures render. It does not prove that the live promo or relations API returns those
  payloads, that login or token verification works, or that create/deactivate succeed against
  the server.
- **The RealUnit compliance visual spec answers the customer list, Dilisense actions, and dossier itself.**
  `e2e/realunit-compliance.spec.ts` fulfils `GET /v1/realunit/compliance/customers`,
  `GET /v1/realunit/compliance/customers/:id`, `GET /v1/realunit/compliance/name-check`,
  `POST /v1/realunit/compliance/name-check` and `POST /v1/realunit/compliance/customers/:id/name-check`
  with synthetic fixtures (including `addresses` and name-check results). Auth is a synthetic Admin
  JWT plus staff bootstrap GETs. Unmatched `GET /v1/**` calls return `[]` and other unmatched
  `/v1/**` methods return `{}`, so a green visual run does not prove which other staff endpoints the
  screen calls. A green run proves those fixtures render, including the Screen / Screen-all confirm
  dialogs and a running-batch state. It does not prove that the API returns that payload, that login
  works, or that the server filters to RealUnit wallets.
- **Two specs force KYC completeness.** Both collection-invoice cases — the refused QR and the
  stored-detail error — override `**/v2/user` so that `kyc.dataComplete` is read as `true`, because
  the invoice button is gated on that value. A green run therefore proves nothing about the gate for
  a customer who has not completed KYC; a unit test covers that path.
- **The same two specs fabricate the invoice rejection.** Each answers
  `**/v1/buy/paymentInfos/*/invoice*` with a `400` and the fixed
  `CollectionAccountInvoicePersonalIbanMissing` error token, so a green run proves that the screen
  displays that token, not that the API emits it for this request. A unit test against the message
  mapping pins the token contract instead.
- **The staff ticket customer-note visual spec answers the issue payload itself.**
  `e2e/support-ticket-note.spec.ts` fulfils `GET /v1/support/issue/:id/data`, the message thread
  for that uid, clerks, clerk mapping and activity with synthetic fixtures. A green run proves
  that the Kundennotiz composer renders those fixtures. It does not prove that the API returns
  that issue or that `createSupportNote` persists a note.
- **The staff ticket KYC-file-transfer visual spec answers the issue payload itself.**
  `e2e/support-kyc-file-transfer.spec.ts` answers the issue payload, messages, clerks, clerk mapping
  and activity with fixtures. A green run proves those fixtures render. It does not prove that the
  API returns them or that PUT kycFile persists.
- **The support-issue receiver-IBAN spec pins KYC level and account mail on GET /v2/user.**
  `e2e/support-issue-receiver-iban.spec.ts` rewrites that response so `kyc.level` is high enough for
  the screen guard and `mail` is present if the cached wallet session has none. A green visual run
  therefore does not prove the mail-first redirect, nor that the account actually has mail or a
  completed KYC level.
- **The stubbed list Open-invoice and Open-receipt tests fulfill the document routes.**
  In `e2e-stack/specs/transactions.spec.ts`, the two cases that set
  `page.route('**/v1/transaction/*/invoice')` — the delayed-tab case and the error-message case —
  and the two Open-receipt cases that set `page.route('**/v1/transaction/*/receipt*')` answer
  those routes with a static PDF body or a `400` with a fixed message. A green run proves that
  the click reserves a tab and surfaces the error, not that the API can build an invoice or
  receipt from SQL-seeded `buy_crypto`.
- **The waiting-for-payment Open-invoice case hits the real invoice route.**
  The same spec file lets `PUT /v1/transaction/:uid/invoice` run against the API for a CHF
  `WaitingForPayment` buy and asserts HTTP 200 plus a `%PDF` prefix, and that the quote
  remittance matches the buy route reference. A green run does not prove the PDF content
  (streams are compressed and unread), live prices (the quote uses the `price_rule` backfill
  from `global.setup.ts`), or EUR. It also does not prove that the IBAN in the document is the
  one the quote showed: every quote in this environment uses the collection account and stores
  no bank selection.
- **The transaction-invoice visual spec answers the waiting buy row itself.**
  `e2e/transaction-invoice.spec.ts` fulfils `GET /v1/transaction/detail` with a synthetic CHF
  `WaitingForPayment` buy, signs in with an unsigned client-side session token, and answers
  `/v2/user`, `/v1/transaction/unassigned` and the startup lookups itself. A green run proves that
  this row shows Open invoice and hides Open receipt. It does not prove login or session handling,
  that the API returns the row, or that it can build its invoice; the full-stack case covers the
  real invoice route.
- **The compliance-review KYC-status spec answers staff identity itself.**
  `e2e/compliance-review-kyc-status.spec.ts` fulfils `GET /v1/support/issue/clerk` with
  `{ clerk }` and, as fallback, `GET /v1/support/{id}` for any account other than the customer
  fixture with `{ userData: { verifiedName } }`. A green run proves that the review screen
  accepts that name, not that the API returns the logged-in staff member's `verifiedName`.
  The spec covers the resettable AML-reset path and the pending ManualCheck decision form
  in the Fail (AmlReason visible, priceDefinitionAllowedDate hidden) and Reset (hint, both
  hidden) variants. A green run does not prove live API payloads or that the Editor label
  is the logged-in staff member's `verifiedName`.
- **The call-queue outcome spec answers staff identity and the dossier itself.**
  `e2e/compliance-call-queue-outcome.spec.ts` fulfils `GET /v1/support/issue/clerk` with
  `{ clerk }`, a differently named fallback on `GET /v1/support/{staffAccount}`,
  `GET /v1/support/{customer}` with a synthetic dossier, empty lookup lists, a null
  info banner, and `GET /v2/user` with a synthetic account. A green run proves the
  outcome form renders that clerk name as a read-only signature and does not request a
  clerks list, not that the API returns those records or the logged-in staff member's
  `verifiedName`. The session is a synthetic unsigned JWT, so a green run also does not
  prove login or token verification.
- **Full-stack guest assign/refund specs SQL-write `transaction.actionSecretHash`.**
  `e2e-stack/specs/transactions.spec.ts` (`seedActionSecret`) updates the hash directly. A green run
  does **not** prove that the mail/API path creates, hashes, or delivers the action secret.
- **Full-stack buy specs SQL-write `user_data.depositLimit`.**
  `e2e-stack/specs/buy.spec.ts` (`openQuoteCapableBuy` and older quote cases) updates the limit
  directly so `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` does not hide payment info. A green run does **not** prove that a
  customer reaches that limit through the product path.
- **Full-stack continue-race specs SQL-write `user_data.tradeApprovalDate`.**
  `e2e-stack/specs/kyc-continue-race.spec.ts` sets the date so recommendation is skipped. A green
  run does **not** prove that a customer obtains trade approval through the product path.
- **Full-stack continue-race specs SQL-insert STRICT `TfaLog` rows.**
  `e2e-stack/specs/kyc-continue-race.spec.ts` inserts `kyc_log` type `TfaLog` with comment
  `Strict (App)` so `continue()` does not 403 after FinancialData starts. A green run does
  **not** prove the mail/app 2FA enrolment or verification path.
- **Full-stack continue-race specs recreate `kyc_step` unique index `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`.**
  `e2e-stack/specs/kyc-continue-race.spec.ts` drops the synchronize unique index on
  `(userDataId, name, type, sequenceNumber)` and creates `IDX_3a1150791476264753a67212a1`
  with `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`, matching production. A green run does **not** prove the
  migration chain applied that index.
- **Full-stack continue-race specs SQL-complete KYC steps.**
  `e2e-stack/specs/kyc-continue-race.spec.ts` upserts ContactData, PersonalData, NationalityData
  and Ident (`SumsubAuto`) to `Completed`. A green run does **not** prove those steps complete
  through the product path, including live ident.
- **The settings verification-call visual spec answers GET /v2/user itself.**
  `e2e/settings-verification-call.spec.ts` fulfils `/v2/user` with three synthetic kyc payloads
  (`phoneCallAccepted` unset / true / false) and fulfils the Settings bootstrap GETs
  (`/v1/language`, `/v1/fiat`, `/v1/asset`, `/v1/bankAccount`, `/v1/country`,
  `/v1/setting/infoBanner`) plus user PUT/PATCH. Unmatched `/v1/**` and `/v2/**` calls
  get `501`. The session is a synthetic unsigned JWT, so a green run does not prove
  login or token verification. A green run proves those three consent states render.
  It does not prove that a live account has those kyc fields, that those bootstrap
  endpoints return real data, that `updateCallSettings` persists, or that
  Completed/Failed hide the section.
- **The settings Danger Zone visual spec answers GET /v2/user itself.**
  `e2e/settings-danger-zone.spec.ts` fulfils `/v2/user` with a synthetic kyc payload
  (`phoneCallStatus: 'Completed'`) and fulfils the Settings bootstrap GETs
  (`/v1/language`, `/v1/fiat`, `/v1/asset`, `/v1/bankAccount`, `/v1/country`,
  `/v1/setting/infoBanner`) plus user PUT/PATCH. Unmatched `/v1/**` and `/v2/**` calls
  get `501`. The session is a synthetic unsigned JWT, so a green run does not prove
  login or token verification. A green run proves the collapsed, expanded and overlay
  fixtures render. It does not prove that those bootstrap endpoints return real data,
  that a live account has that kyc status, or that `deleteAccount` persists against
  the API.
- **The info-banner layout visual spec answers GET /v1/setting/infoBanner itself.**
  `e2e/info-banner-layout.spec.ts` fulfils `/v1/setting/infoBanner` with synthetic
  multilingual copy, fulfils `GET /v1/support/issue` with one fixture ticket, and
  fulfils the Support bootstrap GETs (`/v1/language`, `/v1/fiat`, `/v1/asset`,
  `/v1/bankAccount`, `/v1/country`, `/v2/user`). Unmatched `/v1/**` and `/v2/**`
  calls get `501`. The session is a synthetic unsigned JWT, so a green run does not
  prove login or token verification. A green run proves the banner renders below
  the header on `/support` and `/support/tickets`. It does not prove that the API
  returns that banner copy, that those bootstrap endpoints return real data, or
  that a live account has that ticket.
- **Full-stack screen-sync regressions hold delivery of real API responses.**
  `e2e-stack/specs/screen-sync.spec.ts` intercepts `GET /v2/kyc/file/:id` and
  `GET /v1/dashboard/financial/latest`, calls `route.fetch()` against the real API, then
  delays `route.fulfill` of that same response body (no invented success payload). A green
  run does **not** prove the API's natural latency or that production clients never race; it
  only proves the wait barriers refuse to conclude while that held real response is still
  undelivered, and that hub re-navigation does not abort it.
- **The 2FA merged-account redirect spec answers the 2FA setup call and its post-redirect
  follow-up itself.** `e2e/tfa-merged-redirect.spec.ts` fulfils `POST /v2/kyc/2fa` with a
  synthetic 401 merged-account error (`switchToCode`) and fulfils `GET /v2/kyc` — the call the
  `/kyc` screen makes on its own after the redirect — with a synthetic success payload, plus
  the bootstrap GETs (`/v1/language`, `/v1/fiat`, `/v1/asset`, `/v1/bankAccount`, `/v1/country`,
  `/v1/setting/infoBanner`) and `POST /v1/log/clientError`. Unmatched `/v1/**` and `/v2/**`
  calls get `501`. This spec does not seed an auth token — the `/2fa` merged-account path is
  reached via the URL `code` param without a login, so there is no session to assert cleared,
  unlike the link spec below. The initial navigation also carries a synthetic
  `kyc-redirect=https://evil.example` param; the app itself (not mocked) runs the real
  `navigation.hook.ts` merge/strip logic, and the spec asserts that param is absent from the
  post-redirect URL. A green run proves the `/kyc` screen renders without a `pageerror` on the
  synthetic follow-up payload, and that the `kyc-redirect` param is genuinely stripped by the
  real code (not just requested — `src/__tests__/merged-account.hook.test.tsx` only proves
  `handleMergedError` calls `navigate` with `clearParams: ['kyc-redirect']` against a mocked
  `useNavigation`, not that the real merge logic honors it). It does not prove that the API
  ever returns a 401 with `switchToCode` for a merged account, that a real 2FA setup call has
  that shape, or that the `/kyc` screen's own follow-up call succeeds against a real backend.
  `src/__tests__/tfa.screen.test.tsx` pins that `handleMergedError` is tried first at every
  catch site instead.
- **The link merged-account redirect spec answers GET /v2/user and GET /v2/kyc itself.**
  `e2e/link-merged-redirect.spec.ts` seeds a synthetic unsigned JWT into
  `localStorage['dfx.authenticationToken']` and fulfils `GET /v2/user` with a synthetic account
  whose `kyc.hash` matches the merged (slave) account. It fulfils `GET /v2/kyc` with a
  synthetic 401 merged-account error on the first call and a synthetic success payload on the
  follow-up call after the redirect (the `/kyc` screen's own call), plus the bootstrap GETs
  (`/v1/language`, `/v1/fiat`, `/v1/asset`, `/v1/bankAccount`, `/v1/country`,
  `/v1/setting/infoBanner`) and `POST /v1/log/clientError`. Unmatched `/v1/**` and `/v2/**`
  calls get `501`. The initial navigation also carries a synthetic
  `kyc-redirect=https://evil.example` param; the app itself (not mocked) runs the real
  `navigation.hook.ts` merge/strip logic, and the spec asserts that param is absent from the
  post-redirect URL. It also proves the synthetic auth token is cleared from `localStorage`
  after the redirect — not that any server-side session or token is actually invalidated,
  since the backend is entirely mocked. A green run proves the `/kyc` screen renders without a
  `pageerror` on the synthetic follow-up payload, and that the `kyc-redirect` param is
  genuinely stripped by the
  real code (not just requested — `src/__tests__/merged-account.hook.test.tsx` only proves
  `handleMergedError` calls `navigate` with `clearParams: ['kyc-redirect']` against a mocked
  `useNavigation`, not that the real merge logic honors it). It does not prove that login or
  token verification works, that the API returns that user/`kyc.hash` pairing, or that a
  merged account really produces a 401 with `switchToCode`.
  `src/__tests__/link.screen.test.tsx` pins that `handleMergedError` is tried first at every
  catch site instead.
- **The known-rejections visual spec answers the rejections itself.**
  `e2e/known-rejections.spec.ts` fulfils `GET /v2/kyc/PersonalData` and `GET /v2/kyc` with a
  synthetic step session, `PUT` on that session with a synthetic 400 character-set message,
  `GET /v1/transaction/single` with a synthetic failed buy, the guest refund `GET`/`PUT` under
  `/v1/transaction/uid/:uid/:secret/refund` with synthetic refund details and a synthetic 400
  `iban BIC not allowed`, the external IP geolocation lookup with a synthetic Swiss answer (the KYC
  form prefills its country from it), plus the bootstrap GETs (`/v1/language`,
  `/v1/fiat`, `/v1/asset`, `/v1/bankAccount`, `/v1/country`, `/v1/setting/infoBanner`) and
  `POST /v1/log/clientError`. Unmatched `/v1/**` and `/v2/**` calls get `501`. A green run proves
  that the field error, the character-set hint and the blocked-bank hint render for those
  messages. It does not prove that the API still words its rejections that way, that it rejects
  exactly the characters the form rejects, or that a real bank is blocked; the message sentences
  and the character set (every code point up to U+024F) are pinned in unit tests instead. Nor does it
  prove that the external geolocation service is reachable, still answers in that shape, or maps
  a real client IP to the expected country. It also does not prove that the KYC step, transaction,
  refund and bootstrap endpoints return these payloads for a real account, or that client-error
  reports reach the real endpoint.
- **The Open CryptoPay unit test replaces `url()` and the API config with fixed hosts.**
  `src/__tests__/open-crypto-pay.test.ts` mocks `Api` as `https://api.dfx.swiss` / `v1` and
  swaps `url` from `src/util/utils` for a copy whose `base` falls back to the placeholder
  `https://app.dfx.swiss` instead of `REACT_APP_PUBLIC_URL`, without the real function's
  absolute-path branch. A green run proves only substrings, each in a separate test: the result
  contains `lightning=LNURL` and `pl`, and the decoded LNURL contains `lnurlp/<id>` and
  `https://api.dfx.swiss/v1`; one more test proves that two different ids give different
  results. It does not prove the exact `pl?lightning=…` link or the exact
  decoded API URL, which host the real `url()` or `Api` resolve to in any deployment, or that
  the real `url()` treats those arguments identically; no assertion pins the outer host.

## Known gaps

All four points below concern the full-stack harness.

- **No layer here verifies a payment end to end.** The harness sets `DISABLED_PROCESSES=*`
  (`e2e-stack/env/api.env`); what that switches off in the API is described in the companion document
  there — every process-gated cron job — so the processing chain never executes;
  transaction states are inserted with SQL instead. What is verified is the synchronous path:
  interaction, HTTP, validation, authorisation, persistence, display. (A cron without a `process` field
  is not covered by that switch and keeps running — see the companion document in `DFXswiss/backend`.)
- **The harness does not exercise the migration chain.** It builds the schema from the entities,
  because one migration requires a seed row that does not exist at migration time on a fresh
  database. Migrations are covered in `DFXswiss/backend` instead.
- **The harness lives in the wrong repository.** It tests the API as much as this frontend, and
  `DFXswiss/backend` has to check this repository out to obtain it. See the target below.
- **The suite is serialised.** All specs share one database and one API instance — `e2e-stack/compose.yml`
  declares a single `db` and a single `api` service — with no per-test isolation, so it runs on a single
  worker with retries disabled (`workers: 1` and `retries: 0` in `e2e-stack/playwright.config.ts`, whose
  comment states the reason): a retry would mask exactly the order-dependent failure this arrangement
  produces. It bounds how far the suite can grow.

## Target architecture

_Target — not built yet._ In the order the work should happen:

1. **Per-worker isolation** (a schema or database per worker), so the suite can be parallelised. Cheap
   while it is small.
2. **Move the harness out of this repository** — into `DFXswiss/backend` or a repository of its own,
   consuming published frontend and API images by tag instead of sibling checkouts. The stage depends
   on the applications, never the reverse.
3. **Adopt a coverage ratchet for the unit layer**, replacing a rule that CI cannot enforce with one
   that can only move upward.

Each step is additive; none requires discarding what exists.

## Keeping this document honest

Every **measured** number carries the commit it was measured on and the command that produces it; that
is what keeps the figures maintainable. Counts that a reader can verify by looking — how many entries an
adjacent list has, for instance — need no stamp. When a layer changes what it proves, or a fake is added,
removed or altered, this document changes in the same pull request.
